# How to format StereoMorph data for CheckEM

StereoMorph is an open source R package, allowing image annotation through R.
There is not a defined format for the output file, it is up to the user to define how they export the data after the images are annotated. 
Here, we put forward a workflow to use StereoMorph with the CheckEM shiny app.

# Instructions
1. In the r folder, there is a R script named 01_Open StereoMorph and save data.R
2. Follow the instructions in the script to launch StereoMorph using the example imagery.
3. Annotate imagery.
4. Follow the instructions in the script to save data into a format ready to use by CheckEM
5. Upload to CheckEM

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Alberto Garcia Baciero for providing example imagery, R scripts, and landmarks.
